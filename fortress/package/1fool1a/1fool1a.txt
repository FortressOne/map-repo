Comments                : Two Fort Design, capture the enemy flag and return
                          it to your fort's drop off point.  Has a secret
                          sniper spot, couple extra goodies to enhance your
                          playing.  Let me know what you think or if you have
                          any ideas you'd like to see in future maps.
                          First in a collection of maps by The Fool's Quarter.

Revision A              : I changed all the resupply bags to give the same thing,
                          including a Detpack.  I also made the bridge smaller and
                          I used a different brush color to avoid the confusion I 
                          was told about.  A few of the lights where move around
                          abit to add or remove shadows to enhance game play.

Thanks:  Id Software, the greatest of games.  TeamFortress, making a great
         game even better.  QuakeWorld and GameSpy, I never knew life on
         the internet could be so easy.  Last by not least, Armin Rigo
         for Quark, what a great and easy to use program.  Thanks a lot!
