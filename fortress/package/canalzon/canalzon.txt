Known Bugs              : 1 bug which shows up in QuakeWorld only. On occasion,
			  when a command point is captured, the key model does
			  not appear properly over the newly captured spot.
			  Sometimes it shows up after about 5 seconds, sometimes
			  longer, sometimes not at all. Fortunately, this _does not_ 
			  effect scoring, and future versions of Team Fortress
			  might be able to correct this bug. There is nothing that
			  can be done about it from my end. *8-(
Build Time              : Too damn long. *8-) 3-4 weeks of intensive work
			  spread out over several months. Now that I have the
			  hang of things, my next levels should go much faster.
			  Compile time of roughly 2.5 hours on a P200 w/128 meg 
			  of RAM. (borrowed computer, heh)

Thanks to               - id software of course for Quake
			- all of the Team Fortress guys for a great patch
			- most especially Robin of TF for his tons of help
			  with learning the TF entities and getting them working
			  properly
			- Vortex and Clan Gothic Terror for helping me test this
			  map on their QW server
			- Clan Phantasm for the idea for the intermission scene. Heh.
			- Regi for letting me use his office computers for compiling
			  and testing.
			- Matt Armstrong for general brainstorming and various good
			  ideas. *8-)
			- Apologies if I missed anyone.

General overview:

 This is a two-team Team Fortress map using an entirely new scoring system that
I call my Command Point System. Scoring is based on the idea of territorial control
of a level, centered around a number of command points spread throughout the map.
Control of a command point signifies general control of the surrounding area of
the map. There are eight command points in the Canal Zone, and the scoring works
like this:

	- Each command point can only be controlled by one team at a time (duh).

	- Once a team takes control of a command point, that team gets 1 point
	  for every 30 seconds they remain in control.

	- To take control of a command point, someone must take one of the four
	  command markers (they look like keys) from their own base, and take it
	  to the command point they want to control. While carrying a command
	  marker, the player runs at half speed and glows. The half speed feature
	  is intended to make it very difficult for lone runners to just dash in
	  and claim a command point by simply dodging the defense.

	- As soon as a command marker touches a command point, the command point
	  is under control of whichever team just claimed it. An appropriately
	  colored key appears above the command point to show who is in control.
	  The command marker is taken from the carrying player and reappears back
	  at base for further use.

	- In addition to getting points for owning a command point, most command
	  points also have ammo packs and healing pads nearby which become
	  accessible to the controlling team. Future versions of the Canal Zone
	  (once v2.6 is released) should also include new respawn points which
	  become accessible through control of a command point.

	- Control of all of a team's command points can be broken at once by
	  setting a detpack in the control room of their base.

Other nifty features:

 That funny looking thing on the wall of each base with blue, red, and white spots
is a fairly general map of the level. Since there's no real detail, it's no good
for navigation. It's there so that teams can see who is control of which command
points without having to scout the whole level. As soon as a team captures a command
point, the 30 second score timer is activated. 30 seconds after a command point is
taken, the corresponding white dot (representing a command point) on the map changes
color to show who owns it. I didn't originally intend the 30-second delay, but I
don't think it really hurts things at all, and I've actually decided I kinda like it.

 There are two spots on this level where detpacks can be used to create an alternate
path to a command point.


Random notes:

 I know I'm missing some general messages that should be activated when you do
things like pick up a command marker, but I discovered that there's a very annoying 
entity size limit in Quake levels, and I blew right past it the first time I tried 
to do a full compile with all the entities. As a result, I had to condense things 
a lot and take out things that weren't absolutely necessary. Fortunately, version 
2.6 of Team Fortress should include new abbreviations for entities that I can use, 
and that'll give me a little more space to work with, so hopefully I'll be able to 
flesh things out a little.

 The file size of this level is a bit too large to run with the standard 8mb ram
limit. You'll either need to use the -winmem command or just use winquake. QuakeWorld
users shouldn't have a problem since I believe it already requires 16mb of ram.
